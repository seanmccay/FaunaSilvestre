Art gallery website for my wife Shelby who started painting again recently and opened an Etsy page. 

I'm using this as an opportunity to learn how to use Vue JS and Bootstrap. 

I'm hoping to use this as a part of my portfolio of web development work. If anyone wants to take a look at what I've done and use it as an example that would be great. Let me know if it helps you or if you have some advice or suggestions!
